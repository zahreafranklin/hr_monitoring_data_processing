## Question 1

Take a look at the file labeled `data/phase0.txt`. Why might we have missing values or values that state "NO DATA" in this dataset? While we are currently ignoring these values, what might be the risk of filtering these values out?

[ We might have missing values or values that state NO DATA due to errors such as transmission error or hardware malfunctions. The risk of filtering out these values might be misleading statistics or create a bias in reading and understanding the data.]


## Question 2

During sleep, we expect maximum heart rate of a phase to be **lower** than the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase does sleep occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings.

[ Based on the findings, sleep occurs in **Phase 0**. The maximum heart rate was **93 bpm** which was significantly lower than the other phases. The other results indicate that the average heart rate in Phase 0 was **64.59 bpm** which is lower than all the other phases.]

## Question 3

During exercise, we expect the maximum heart rate of a phase to be **higher** the maximum heart rate of all other phases. Observe the visualizations and descriptive statistics that you've calculated. Using these findings, in which phase(s) does exercise occur? Mention numerical details that back your findings. 

[ Based on the findings, exercise occurs in **Phase 2**. The maximum heart rate was **117** which was significantly higher than the other phases. There was also values in Phase 2 like **106 bpm**, **112 bpm** and **117bpm** which indicates the individual was very active. This makes sense since if someone is exercising they are expected to have an elevated heart rate. ]

## Question 4

During regular periods of awake activity, we expect the average heart rate of a phase to be relatively **lower** than the average heart rate of other phases, but we also expect standard deviation to be **higher**. In which phase do we notice this trend?

[ This trend would be noticed in **Phase 3** since it demonstrates the expected pattern of a relatively lower average heart rate of **60.65** when compared to the other phases but has a higher standard deviation of **11.0 bpm** when compared to the other phases except for Phase 2 where exercising was taking place.However, these findings correspond with the individual being awake and active throughout the day. ]
